    "Gym-like Simplified Environment for Distribution Network Restoration for RL in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. motivation\n",
    "Distribution Network Restoration (DNR) problem is to maximize the load survival rate when the distribution network fails. When there is a slight fault in the power grid, it can be easily realized by topology reconstruction.In case of major disasters, splitting may be a better strategy. When the disaster is over, how to reasonably plan the maintenance path is also an important problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are usually three mothods in DNR problem:  \n",
    "1.  Mathematical optimization => MILP MISOCP... using DistFlow powerflow model   \n",
    "2.  MAS => software... such as JADE  \n",
    "3.  Heuristics Search =>  GA ... for NP-Hard \n",
    "   \n",
    "However, all these methods above need to master all kinds of parameters of the system accurately. Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool to handle the problem with unknown parameters. The successful implementation of reinforcement learning requires interactive environment, but there is no distribution network environment in Gym. This project aims to provide a simplified Gym-like environment with high scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Technology origin\n",
    "To our best knowledge, the only open source distribution network environment for reinforcement learning is Grid2Op.(https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op)  \n",
    "Grid2Op is luneched by RTE and used for the power grid dispatching AI competition named L2RPN.(http://L2rpn.chalearn.org)  \n",
    "However, Grid2Op is a customized competition environment, which is difficult to be directly used in DNR problems. Case33Py, with IEEE-33BW case adopted by default, is a easily customized environment using the same underlying technology(Pandapower, GraphX) as Grid2Op.   \n",
    "Inspired by Gao,2020,TSG, an experience generator is added based on MOSEK and Fuison, which is important for offline RL. \n",
